              An annuity is a financial product that provides a steady income
              stream, typically used as part of a retirement plan. Its a
              contract between an individual and an insurance company, where the
              individual makes a lump sum payment or series of payments, and in
              return, the insurance company provides regular disbursements,
              either immediately or at a future date.

              Disadvantages of Annuities
            </h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>High Fees:</strong> Annuities often come with various
                fees, including administrative fees, mortality and expense risk

              <li>
                <strong>Lack of Liquidity:</strong> Once you invest in an
                annuity, it can be difficult and expensive to withdraw funds
                early, often leading to surrender charges.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Complexity:</strong> Annuities can be complex products
                with many variations, making it difficult for investors to fully
                understand what they are purchasing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lower Returns:</strong> Compared to other investment
                options, annuities might offer lower returns, especially when
                accounting for fees and inflation.

              <li>
                <strong>Tax Treatment:</strong> While tax-deferred growth is an
                advantage, when you eventually receive payments, they are taxed
                as ordinary income, which may be higher than the capital gains
                tax rate.
              </li>
            </ul>
