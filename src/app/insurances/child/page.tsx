            How Child Insurance Will Benefit Your Child&apos;s Future
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Child insurance is more than just a policy; it&apos;s a strategic
            financial tool that secures a promising future for your child. By
            investing in a child insurance plan, you create a financial cushion
            for key milestones such as higher education, marriage, or starting a
            business.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            This type of insurance offers dual benefits: savings and protection.
            It combines the safety of a life insurance policy with an investment
            component that grows over time, ensuring funds are available when
            needed most.

            Consequences of Not Having Child Insurance
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Without a dedicated child insurance plan, families may face
            unexpected financial difficulties that could hinder their ability to
            support their child&apos;s ambitions. In such cases, parents might
            have to rely on high-interest loans, increasing their financial
            burden.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Restricted Education Opportunities:</strong> Lack of funds
              can limit access to quality education.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased Financial Stress:</strong> Unpreparedness may
              lead to reliance on loans or credit, affecting long-term financial
              stability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This lack of preparedness can restrict your child&apos;s ability to
            pursue their passions, potentially affecting their future prospects
            and career trajectory.
