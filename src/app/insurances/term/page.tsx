            Understanding Term Insurance: Affordable Protection for Your Loved
            Ones
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage
            for a specific period or &quot;term.&quot; If the insured person
            passes away during the term, the policy pays a death benefit to the
            beneficiaries. Term insurance is known for its affordability, making
            it a popular choice for individuals looking to secure financial
            protection for their families.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Unlike permanent life insurance, term insurance does not accumulate
            cash value. It is designed purely for protection, ensuring that your
            loved ones are financially secure in case of your untimely demise.
            Let&apos;s dive deeper into the different types of term insurance,
            the benefits it offers, and how to choose the right policy.

            How to Choose the Right Term Insurance Plan
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Selecting the right term insurance plan requires careful
            consideration of your financial needs, life stage, and family
            responsibilities. Here&apos;s how you can make an informed decision:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Assess Your Coverage Needs:</strong> Determine how much
              coverage your family would need to maintain their lifestyle and
              meet financial obligations in your absence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose the Right Term Length:</strong> Consider your
              current age, retirement plans, and the duration of your financial
              responsibilities (e.g., children&apos;s education, home loan).
            </li>

              <strong>Compare Plans:</strong> Evaluate different term plans
              based on premium, sum assured, policy features, and customer
              reviews before making a choice.

            <li>
              <strong>Add Riders:</strong> Enhance your policy with riders such
              as critical illness cover, accidental death benefit, or waiver of
              premium to increase your protection.

            Common Exclusions in Term Insurance Plans

          <p className="mb-4">
            While term insurance provides essential coverage, certain situations
            may not be covered under the policy. Understanding these exclusions
            can help avoid surprises later:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-5 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Suicide Clause:</strong> Most term insurance policies have
              a suicide exclusion for the first one or two years, meaning no
              death benefit is paid if the insured commits suicide within this
              period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Death Due to Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> If the
              insured passes away due to a pre-existing medical condition that
              was not disclosed at the time of policy purchase, the claim may be
              rejected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Participation in Hazardous Activities:</strong> Death
              resulting from high-risk activities such as skydiving or scuba
              diving may be excluded unless specifically covered by the policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Intoxication:</strong> Death occurring while under the
